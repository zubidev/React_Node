# React_Node

## Project Overview
The **React_Node** project focuses on developing a RESTful API to manage meeting-related data. The task involved building an API using **Node.js** and **Express** to handle operations like creating, reading, updating, and deleting meeting information. This project is divided into two main components: the **Client** (React front-end) and the **Server** (Node.js back-end).

- **Create new meetings**
- **Retrieve meeting details**
- **Delete meetings**

The backend server is configured with routes and controllers to handle these operations, while the React front-end interacts with the API to manage meeting data effectively.

## Technologies Used
- **Front-end**: React.js
- **Back-end**: Node.js, Express.js
- **Version Control**: Git, GitHub

## Setup Instructions
### 1. Clone the Repository
To get started, clone the repository to your local machine: `git clone https://github.com/zubidev/React_Node.git`

### 2. Install Dependencies
#### For the Client (React):
Navigate to the `Client` folder and install the necessary dependencies: `cd Client` and `npm install`

#### For the Server (Node.js):
Navigate to the `server` folder and install the required dependencies: `cd server` and `npm install`

## How to Run
### Running the Client (React):
To start the front-end React application, use the following command inside the `Client` folder: `npm start`. This will start the React application on `http://localhost:3000`.

### Running the Server (Node.js):
To run the back-end server, navigate to the `server` folder and run: `npm start`. The server will run on `http://localhost:5000`.
